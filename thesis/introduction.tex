\section{Motivation}
Increase of performance and power efficiency are the main goal of processor designers.
Unfortunatly we are currently reaching the limits of the current strategies for further development.
For some time, our processors have been strugeling to achive increased performance.
Heat stops us from driving the clock frequency higher, while memory is lagging more and more behind.
A solution to enable continued performance growth is multicore processors, and for the last decade this has been the focus.
Unfortunatly adding cores will not be a sustainable solution forever.
As the amount of cores grow, they are still competing for the same system resources and may have to wait for eachother to complete calculations on data with dependencies.

A promissing solution to this issue is heterogenous multi-processor systems.
Heterognous multi-processor systems utilize multiple different processor cores in the same system.
This allow different parts of a program to be executed on a suitable processor.
By using a suitable core for each part of the program it is possible to achive better performance than homogenous multi-processor systems.

\section{Project Scope and Goal}
This pilot projects main goal is to do preliminary research and experiments on the energy efficiency of the Exynos 5 processor, with the intent to use the results next spring in my master thesis.
The goal of this research is to explore the potential of the task based programming model heterogenous multi-processor systems.

\section{Problem Statement Interpretation and Approach}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Task 1: Implement or adapt suitable experiment applications for testing energy efficiency.
  \item Task 2: Implement some energy efficiency measurement application for both Arendale duo and Odroid-xu3.
  \item Task 3: Optimize experiment applications for both platforms.
  \item Task 4: Gather performance and energy efficiency results from the experiment applications on both platforms.
  \item Task 5: Analyze and evaluate experiment results.
\end{itemize}

TODO: Introduce how these tasks were solved.

\section{Outline}
TODO: This section need to be completed after the outline of the report is done.
