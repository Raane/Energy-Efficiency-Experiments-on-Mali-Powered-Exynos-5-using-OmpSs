\section{Motivation}
Increase of performance and power efficiency are the main goal of processor designers.
Unfortunatly we are currently reaching the limits of the current strategies for further development.
For some time, our processors have been strugeling to achive increased performance.
Heat stops us from driving the clock frequency higher, while memory is lagging more and more behind.
A solution to enable continued performance growth is multicore processors, and for the last decade they have been doing just that.
Unfortunatly adding cores will not be a sustainable solution forever.
As the amount of cores grow, they are still competing for the same system resources and may have to wait for eachother to complete calculations on data with dependencies.

A promissing solution to this issue is heterogenous multi-processor systems.
Heterognous multi-processor systems utilize multiple different processor cores in the same system.
This allow different parts of a program to be executed on a suitable processor, to achive better performance and energy efficiency.


Not only a hardware issue - Software development for new architecures need to be adapted.

Mont Blanc 

NTNU want experience on this.

Exynos 5

Buildup for a master thesis

\section{Project Scope and Goal}
This pilot projects main goal is to do preliminary research and experiments on the energy efficiency of the Exynos 5 processor, with the intent to use the results next spring in my master thesis.
