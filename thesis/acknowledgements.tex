\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Lasse Natvig, who have been guiding me during the last months.
I would also like to thank my co-supervisor PhD Antonio Garcia Guirado, who have been helping me with all small and large problems that have come up during the research.
They have both been enthusiastically following my work, and continuously guiding me and supplying me with valuable feedback.
I am sincerely thankful for all their help.
