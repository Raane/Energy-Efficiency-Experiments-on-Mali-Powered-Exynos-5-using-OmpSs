\section*{Problem statement}
Energy efficiency experiments on Mali powered Exynos 5 using OmpSs.
\\
\\
The thesis is the pilot project for my planned master thesis the spring of 2015.
The goal of the thesis is to present preliminary data about the energy efficiency of the Exynos 5 using OmpSs.
The experiments should unveil the potencial of task based programming on the Exynos 5.
They should also explore the ARM big.LITTLE architecture, and discuss how well suited task based programming is to achive parallelism on heterogeneous platforms.

Another important purpose of this thesis is to get familiar with the OmpSs system and experiment platforms.
Extensive deep digging experiments does not fit within the scope of this thesis, and it is more important that the research lay down a foundation for future work.
