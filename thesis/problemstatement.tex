\section*{Problem statement}
The report is the pilot project for my planned master thesis in the spring of 2015.
The goal of the project is to present preliminary experiment data about the energy efficiency of the Exynos 5 using OmpSs.
The experiments should unveil the potential of task based programming on the Exynos 5.
They should also explore the ARM big.LITTLE architecture, and discuss how well suited task based programming is to achieve parallelism on heterogeneous platforms.

Another important purpose of this thesis, is to get familiar with the OmpSs system and experiment platforms.
Extensive deep digging experiments does not fit within the scope of this thesis, and it is more important that the research lay down a foundation for future work.
